# Websocket Demo

I just want to build something with Web Sockets, so I followed [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/)
and added a `FloodClients.java` to send an occasional message.

You can see the results at `http://localhost:8080` after running `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.
